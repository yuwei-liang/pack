// was, and swapping provider means editing the URL and body shape here rather than
// changing a dependency.
//
// WITH NO API KEY THE APP STILL WORKS LOCALLY. `npm run dev` against a fresh
// checkout has no RESEND_API_KEY, and the README's promise is that the app runs
// fully on your machine with no environment variables — so in development the link
// is printed to the server console instead of emailed, and sign-in works offline.
// In production a missing key is a real misconfiguration and throws, because
// silently swallowing it would leave users staring at "check your email" forever.
