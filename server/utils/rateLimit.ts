 * (defeating the limit entirely), or pin a victim's IP to get the victim limited.
 *
 * This app deploys on Vercel, so trust only the headers Vercel's edge sets — and

 *   1. `x-vercel-forwarded-for` — Vercel's canonical real-client-IP header.

 *   3. socket remote address (bare `getRequestIP`, no XFF) — last resort, never
 *      client-controlled; this is what dev/PGlite (no edge in front) falls to.
 *
 * Residual: a request sent straight to the `*.vercel.app` origin (bypassing the
 * edge) could forge these headers, but that's a pre-existing platform exposure
 * and out of scope here — the fix that matters is no longer trusting the
 * leftmost XFF. Returns undefined when nothing resolves so callers fall back.

 * script can bind a different source address per request and mint a fresh bucket every
 * time. Every limit here — sign-in links, reports, and the anonymous feedback endpoint
 * that opens PUBLIC issues — was bypassable that way by anyone with an ordinary
 * dual-stack connection.
 *
 * So IPv6 collapses to its /64, which is the smallest block an ISP hands to a single
 * subscriber. IPv4 is kept whole (a /64 has no meaning there, and truncating would
 * bucket a whole carrier-grade NAT together). IPv4-mapped v6 is unwrapped first, or
 * "::ffff:1.2.3.4" would be scoped as though it were v6.
 *
 * Cost: two devices behind one home router already shared a bucket on IPv4 and now do
 * on IPv6 too. That is the intended reading of "one client".
