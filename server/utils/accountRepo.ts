 * passkeys, its claims, and its vault with every item and folder in it. A vault has
 * exactly one owner, so none of that is shared — it's gone in the strong sense
 * rather than soft-deleted, because no link remains that could bring it back and
 * nobody else could miss it.
 *
 * STAYS BY DEFAULT: the lists. A list belongs to its EDIT LINK, not to the account;
 * a claim only ever added a bookmark on top. Deleting the account drops the
 * bookmark and leaves the list open to anyone holding the link, including you.
 * Taking someone's lists away as a side effect of closing an account would be the
 * most destructive thing this could do by accident, so it has to be asked for.
 *
 * `deleteLists` opts into removing them, and only the ones this account claimed.
 * Soft-delete, exactly as the owner pressing Delete on each one, so the nightly
 * purge reclaims them after the usual grace rather than vanishing them mid-read.
