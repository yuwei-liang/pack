# Bundle budget — the ledger, 2026-06 to 2026-09

Every move of the first-load and total budgets in `scripts/bundle-budget.mjs`, in the
words written at the time, from the file's creation to the day the number was split
into a ceiling and a tripwire (2026-09-12). Until then each bump carried its measurement
and its reasoning as a comment beside the constant; that grew to thirty-five kilobytes
of prose in a two-hundred-line script, so it lives here now, unchanged. From that day
the record of what a PR costs is the PR itself: CI measures every one against `main`
and posts the delta, by source, as a comment.

Two lessons this history keeps repeating, so they're worth stating once up front:

- **Measure both ways on the same tree and lockfile.** Most overages were found late,
  after several commits had landed with no build between them; the attribution was
  only ever untangled by building the base commit in a second worktree.
- **The number is a tripwire for accidents, not a limit.** In eleven weeks it was
  raised twenty-one times and lowered twice (once when the yardstick was corrected,
  once after a delivery pass), always with a paragraph and never with a "no" — which
  is what made the ceiling necessary.

The nuxt config, the lazy boundaries and the chunk groups these notes refer to are
described where they live; the wiki's perf pages hold the measurements in full.

## First load (the editor's hot path)

all client JS + CSS, brotli. Bumped 125→127 for nested items (an item can hold nested
items — the same editable row one level down: catalog autocomplete, weight/qty/class,
nest/un-nest, drag) landing on a main baseline already grown to ~124.5 by the changelog
page + catalog search-terms. Bumped 127→128 for two interaction features: drag an item
in/out of a nested group, and the mobile ⋯ overflow menu (a CircleEllipsis glyph + the
per-row menu that tucks the note/nesting actions away on the crowded two-line row).
Bumped 128→133 for the nuxt 4.4.8→4.5.0 client-runtime growth (~4.5 KB brotli); no app
code changed, just the framework we ship.

NOT a bump, but the reason current dropped ~2.4 KB: content/changelog.json used to be a
module-scope import in the changelog page, so every entry was bundled into that
route's client chunk. It was served from a server route after that (the page was
prerendered, so the read happens at build time). That matters beyond the one-off saving
— the house rule is a changelog entry per user-facing PR, so the old shape grew what
this gate measures on PRs that ship no code at all, and the ratchet slowly became a
tax on writing changelog entries. Watch for the same shape in any other checked-in
content: import it in a server route, not a page.

Bumped 133→134 to RE-ANCHOR after that shave, not to make room for anything. The shave
left current at 132.9 against a 133 budget — 0.1 KB, which is below the noise floor
(reflowing a comment in a .vue file can move it), so the gate would have failed on the
next trivial change and been bumped reflexively. That is the failure this ratchet
exists to avoid: a threshold nobody trusts gets raised on autopilot, and then it isn't
a threshold. 134 restores roughly the ~1 KB gap the earlier anchors carried — enough
that a heavy dep or a stray client import still trips it, but ordinary work doesn't.

Bumped 134→136 for the trail link + the list-title block: a new list-level field
threaded through the reducer, shared/trailLink.ts (URL guard + the name derived from a
URL's path), ListHead.vue (the page title, its hover affordance, the link row), and the
matching render on the two read views. ~2.0 KB brotli, measured — the gate caught it at
134.9 and this is the deliberate answer, not a nudge to make red go green. Worth noting
what it did NOT cost: the favicons are fetched server-side and inlined as data: URLs
into SSR HTML, which this gate doesn't measure at all, and the whole page-metadata
scraper the feature originally implied was dropped rather than shipped to the client.
136 keeps the same ~1 KB working headroom the anchor is supposed to carry.

Bumped 136→138 for the hover tooltip + the carried weight. Measured against the same
build both ways: 135.6 KB before, 137.0 after, so +1.4 KB brotli. Most of that is the
tooltip — a new shared component (Tooltip.vue: the flip/clamp positioning, the teleported
popup) plus atoms/tooltip.scss and the two motion curves it brought with it, one of which
is a 51-sample linear() spring. The carried weight itself is nearly free: one derived
field on Totals, one chip, one line in the Markdown export. The tooltip is priced as
infrastructure rather than as one feature — it exists to be reused, and the second and
third consumer cost almost nothing on top of this. 138 restores the ~1 KB headroom.

FIRST LOAD, the ratchet. 118.6 KB with the vault; 120 keeps the working headroom.

RE-ANCHORED 130→120, and NOT because anything got smaller: the measurement was
wrong. firstLoadAssets() counted every /_nuxt ref in the prerendered /e HTML,
including rel="prefetch" — 15 files, ~11 KB brotli, among them VaultPane.css,
ImportModal.css and CatalogCorrectionModal.css. Prefetch is fetched at idle, after
interactive; it is not what a visitor waits on. Counting it contradicted this
file's own header and inverted the incentive the split exists to create — a lazy
pane earned nothing on the ratchet, and growing one was billed to first load
anyway. See firstLoadAssets() for the fix.

The anchor moves with the yardstick so the gate stays exactly as tight as it was:
130 sat ~1.2% above the 128.5 it was measuring, and 120 sits ~1.2% above the 118.6
it measures now. Same ~1.4 KB of working headroom, same trip-wire, real number.
Nothing about the shipped bundle changed in this commit — the two figures are the
same build measured two ways.

Bumped 126→130 for the vault. This is the honest price of it: +6.7 KB on the hot
path, paid by every visitor whether or not they ever open a vault, because
useVaultToken, useVaultSearch and the vault rows in the item autocomplete all land
in the editor chunk — the input offers your own gear alongside the catalog, so that
part can't be lazy. Everything else IS: /vault is a route chunk, VaultPane and
shared/vault.ts are dynamically imported, and the old whole-output gate would have
charged another 4.6 KB for exactly that splitting. If the vault should cost the hot
path less, the lever is the autocomplete integration, not the page.

120→123 on merging main in. Measured 121.1 KB, and the ~2.5 KB since 118.6 is
mostly the framework: main brought nuxt 4.5.1 and a dependency refresh (#154,
#155), which land in the entry chunk. The vault work added to this branch since
— the "which gear is mine" chooser and the merge-another-vault form — is a lazy
modal and a route chunk respectively; what reaches first load from them is the
small amount of controller state in useGearList/useVault that the editor already
pulls in. Same ~1.2% headroom rule as the re-anchor above.

NOTE main independently wrote this same first-load split (8d63e65) and landed on
126, measuring 121.8. That number is NOT comparable: it was measured with the
broader firstLoadAssets() that counts rel="prefetch". This branch's narrower
reading is the one kept, so the anchor is re-derived from what it actually
measures rather than carried over.

123→125 for per-row calories + remembered entry units. Measured 123.1 KB, i.e.
the row work costs ~0.1 KB on the hot path, which is what it should cost: the
only new first-load code is the kcal popover's markup and the entryUnit reads in
ItemRow, both inside a chunk the editor already pulls. computeTotals gained two
accumulators in a loop it already ran; formatKcal is six lines beside
formatWeight. The headroom above the measurement is the usual ~1.2% rule, not
room budgeted for anything in particular.

125→128 for the row's vault button and the always-visible action cluster.
Measured 125.9 KB. The ~2.2 KB since the last anchor is three things, all of them
row-level and so unavoidably on the editor's first load: two more Lucide glyphs
(Vault + Check), the <Tooltip> now wrapped around the row's icon buttons (the
component was already in the graph — this is the extra instances), and
captureOne's call path in useGearList. shared/vault itself is NOT here: captureOne
reaches it through the same dynamic import the automatic capture uses, which is
what keeps the vault module off this number. Same ~1.2% headroom rule.

128→130 for "Send feedback". Measured 128.4 KB. The dialog itself is NOT in this
number — it's a LazyFeedbackModal behind an everOpened guard, so the markup, the
POST and its copy stay in their own chunk. What lands here is the footer's trigger
and the two refs guarding it, and the footer is the one component on every routed
page, so anything it gains is first-load by definition. ~0.5 KB is the honest
price of an entry point that has to be reachable from everywhere.

130→133 for the lucide → hugeicons swap. Measured 130.6 KB, i.e. +2.2 KB, which
lines up with the +1.9 KB the 2026-07-22 preview measured for the same swap: their
path data is curve-heavy, so each glyph costs more than lucide's. Both packages
tree-shake per-glyph, so this is the price of 32 drawings, not of a library.
The swap reverses that preview's "lucide stays" call — see the wiki note, which
has been corrected.

133→135 for the editor's row and meta-row work. Measured 133.3 KB, i.e. +2.7 KB
since the icon anchor, and all of it is on the hot path for the honest reason:
it IS the row. The classification select became two toggle buttons with a popover
each (the worn split, and calories), the row grew a unit selector and a nesting
menu, its actions stopped being hover-hidden, and the meta row gained the dates
affordance and the title pencil. New glyphs across both (Shirt, Cookie,
Calculator, Edit02, Location01, Calendar03, Copy01, and the two account marks)
are the largest single share, at hugeicons' curve-heavy per-glyph rate.

What is deliberately NOT in this number: the sharing panel, the feedback dialog,
the import dialog, the catalog-correction popover, the vault pane, and the date
picker's month grid. All six are Lazy behind an open guard, which is the rule this
gate exists to reward. DateRangePicker was the one that nearly wasn't — ListHead
is first-load, so a statically-imported calendar shipped to every visitor who
never opened it. Making it Lazy is where 0.8 of the overage went; the gate caught
it, which is the gate working. Same ~1.2% headroom rule as the anchors above.

Bumped 135→137 for the list switcher — a labelled count in the editor toolbar
opening a filterable menu of the lists this browser holds, replacing a trip out
to /mine. Measured both ways against the same build: 133.4 before, 135.0 after,
so +1.6 KB brotli. It is first-load by definition (it's in the toolbar), and most
of it is the menu's own filtering and the travelling plate's measuring.

The plate went into the shared .menu atom rather than into this one component, so
the ⋯, account and read-view menus all took it for the cost of a span and four
handlers each — the marginal menu is nearly free, which is the argument for
paying once here. 137 restores the ~1 KB working headroom the anchors carry;
135.0 against a 135 budget is the zero-slack state this file's own note warns
gets raised reflexively on the next trivial change.

137 → 139 for the ACCOUNT MODAL. Measured 135.5 on main before, 137.1 after, so
+1.6 KB brotli. Almost none of that is the account itself — AccountView, the passkey
ceremony and the delete flow are behind <LazyAccountModal v-if="everOpened">, so a
visit that never opens it downloads none of them. What lands on first load is the
part that has to: the singleton + the mount in app.vue, and GLOBAL CSS — the .check
atom (a native checkbox wearing the house icons, now shared by the delete dialog and
VaultPickerModal), the dialog's option row, .dlg's max-height/scroll, and --danger.

A lazy <BaseCheckbox> was tried to keep the two icons off first load and made it
WORSE — 137.3 — because the extra async chunk costs more than the icons it defers.
Reverted; recording it so the next person doesn't repeat it.

139 and not 138, for the same reason the last note gives: 137.1 against 137 is the
zero-slack state this file warns about, and it is what just happened. ~1.9 KB of
working headroom is the point, not tracking current.

139 → 142 for a dependency update — the same shape as the nuxt 4.4.8→4.5.0 note at the
top of this file, and no app code changed. `npm update` inside the existing semver
ranges; measured both lockfiles against the same tree: 138.7 before, 139.7 after, so
+1.0 KB brotli. Nearly all of it is one chunk, the Nuxt entry (+2.3 KB raw / +0.7 KB
brotli), which is where unhead 3.2.3→3.3.1 and devalue 5.8.2→5.9.0 land. vue 3.5.40→
3.5.41 and vite 8.1.5→8.2.0 moved the runtime and the chunking by ~0.1 KB each.

There is nothing to shave here — it is vendor runtime arriving through a routine bump,
and the alternative was pinning a transitive dep to hold a number, which buys 1 KB and
owes a revisit. Worth being honest that the gate was ALREADY at zero slack before this:
138.7 against 139, spent by the plain-text exporter, so the +1.0 KB is what tipped a
budget that had no room left rather than the whole story. 142 re-anchors with the ~2 KB
of working headroom the notes above keep arguing for, so the next heavy dep still trips
the gate and ordinary work doesn't.

142 → 151, and this one needs its two causes kept apart, because the visible change is
a map and the map is not what spent the budget.

Measured both ways against the same tree and the same node_modules, as the notes above
require — a second worktree at the commit before the map work, built with the same
lockfile: 147.0 before, 148.3 after. So the whole route map costs +1.3 KB on the
ratchet, and the gate was ALREADY 5.0 KB over at 147.0 before a line of it was written.
That overage is trail planning itself — the panel, the profile, grade shading, the day
rows — landing over several commits with no build run between them. It is real work and
it belongs on the first load; it just never got priced, and attributing it to the map
now would make the record wrong in a way nobody could untangle later.

+1.3 KB is what a map costs because almost none of it is here. Leaflet is a dynamic
import behind a `v-if` on a list having a route, so it is a 36.5 KB chunk that a plain
packing list never requests — TOTAL pays for it, which is the whole reason these are two
numbers. What DOES land is the waypoint ops and the polyline codec: the reducer runs on
both client and server, so it has to be complete for op replay, and normalizeRouteGeometry
re-encodes canonically and therefore pulls the decoder with it.

Paid for in part by splitting shared/gpx.ts: reading a map file — XML dialects, a zip
decoder, GeoJSON — is several hundred lines that only run when somebody picks a file,
yet the reducer's `parseProfile` import put all of it on the first load of every packing
list. The arithmetic moved to shared/profile.ts and ListHead reaches the reader through
`await import()`. Worth 1.1 KB, and worth more as a rule than as a number: nothing that
only runs on one interaction belongs on the load before it.

151 keeps the ~2 KB of working headroom these notes keep arguing for.

151 → 154 for the rest of trail planning: the waypoint rows and their kind toggles, the
day-boundary handles, the camp each day ends at, the Gear/Packing/Planning bar, and the
corrected burn model. 148.3 at the anchor above, 151.2 now — +2.9 KB, measured by this
script both times against an unchanged lockfile (nothing has touched package.json since
the commit that set 151), so it is a like-for-like reading rather than a fresh two-build
run.

Worth recording what did NOT have to be paid, because both are the split working:
Leaflet is still a 36.5 KB chunk the editor's HTML never references — the ▸ check the
map notes ask for still passes — and the planning panel itself is a <LazyTrailPlanPanel>,
so the panel's own components are not on this line either. What lands here is the
reducer's share: waypoint ops, the boundary arithmetic, the estimator. The reducer runs
on both client and server and has to be complete for op replay, so it cannot be deferred
the way a panel can.

154 restores the same ~2.8 KB gap 151 carried over its own measurement.

154 → 157, and this one is not feature work at all: the gate was ALREADY over when an
audit first ran it. 154.5 against 154, on a tree with nothing of the audit's own in it
— measured in a second worktree at main, same lockfile, to be sure the audit branch
wasn't the cause. Somewhere between the 151.2 reading above and here, ~3.3 KB landed
across several commits with no build run between them, which is the same way the 147.0
overage in the map notes happened. Nothing in CI ran this script, so nothing said so.
The CI workflow added alongside this note is the actual fix; the number below only
stops recording a failure nobody caused.

What it is, measured two ways against the same tree: @vercel/analytics is 4.7 KB of it.
Building with the module removed from nuxt.config's `modules` and changing nothing else
gives 149.8; putting it back gives 154.5. That is a real price for page views and Web
Vitals on every first load, and it was a deliberate keep once seen — analytics is named
in the privacy policy (app/pages/legal.vue) and holds a CSP entry, so dropping it is a
product decision, not a cleanup. Recorded here so the 4.7 KB stays a known, chosen cost
rather than drifting back into the noise.

157 restores the ~2.5 KB of working headroom every anchor above argues for.

157 → 162, the design review (#302) and the group row (#307, #308), measured both ways
as ever. main before #302 (7f9c9bf) builds to 156.9 against 157: a tenth of a KB of the
~2.5 KB the last re-anchor restored was left, spent across the merges since, none of
them over the line. #302 adds 1.9 to first load (158.8): a way back to your last list
from the bare address, a fragment-less edit link that opens your own list, the
first-run screen standing down Export and Duplicate, Report through the feedback box,
and six event counters — editor surface, all of it, on the chunk every visitor gets.
The catalog matching an import does is on the import modal's lazy chunk and costs this
line nothing. The group row's calories and italic total (#307) and the totals row's
order (#308) add 0.3 between them (159.1). Those merged without CI running this script
— squashed straight from a session — so, as with 154 → 157, the first run to see the
number was a later PR's (#309), and this note is where it gets recorded. 162 restores
the ~2.9 KB of working headroom the anchors above argue for.

162 → 151, and this one is a re-anchor DOWNWARD after a loading pass, measured both
ways on the same tree and lockfile: 158.4 KB / 45 files before, 148.5 KB / 22 files
after. Nothing was removed from the editor; the bytes stopped being split. The
bundler cuts one chunk per distinct set of importers, so every module the app shell
shares with a lazy panel or a route had its own file — 39 scripts on this line, 22 of
them under 1 KB brotli, one carrying a 27-byte module — and the split cost ~17 KB of
compression at the file boundaries on top of the requests. nuxt.config's codeSplitting
groups merge the boot graph into a framework chunk and a boot chunk (the reasoning is
there); the payload the prerendered pages fetched separately is inlined; the bare
address renders the editor instead of redirecting an empty page to it, so its HTML
preloads the editor's chunks alongside the shell's (it used to fetch them a round trip
after mount — and this line, measured from /e, never saw that); and two modules that
only the offline ranker and the reducer needed left the hot path of every page (the
text folds moved to shared/searchText.ts, rebaseOnto moved beside applyOps). The
share views dropped 129.4 → 116.6 and About 106.5 → 90.6 from the same work, which
this line doesn't measure either.

The number you see here is the editor's; the editor is the one route that needs the
reducer, so moving it off the shell cost this line 1.1 KB and four files against the
6 KB every other page saved. 151 keeps the ~2.5 KB of working headroom the anchors
above argue for. The largest chunk is now the framework (`vendor`, 52.9 KB) rather
than Leaflet, and that is the point of the split: vue, vue-router and unhead only
change hash on a dependency bump, so a returning visitor keeps them across deploys.

151 → 153, a re-anchor after the connector work. Measured on a clean build of main at
e8db794: 151.0 against 151, i.e. no headroom at all. What spent the 2.5 KB since the
anchor above (148.5): the variant-and-brand rules on every row (#315, #346's shape),
the trip-date year rule (#309), the resume path (#311, #317), and, from the MCP server
(#352), two things the reducer now owns for every caller and therefore every visitor
downloads: the catalog-id bound (`isCatalogId`) and the clear-with-link rule
(`CLEARS_WITH_LINK`, moved to shared/trailLink from the head component). None of that
is a page's worth; it is the editor growing a few dozen bytes per feature, which is
what the anchors above call ordinary. At exactly the line, a branch that adds NOTHING
to the first load fails on the hundred bytes a different chunk graph shuffles between
builds (the account takeout that follows this measured 151.0 too, every byte of it on the account
chunk and the server). 153 restores ~2 KB of working headroom, a little less than the
re-anchors above kept, on purpose: the next feature that lands on the editor's path
should be the one that has to argue.

## Total (every built file — the backstop)

TOTAL of every built file, the backstop. Deliberately slack: its job is to catch
a route chunk ballooning or a heavy dep landing somewhere unnoticed, NOT to price
ordinary feature work. Set clear of the current total (269.0) so it only speaks up when
something has genuinely gone wrong. If you find yourself bumping this one often,
something is being shipped to every page that shouldn't be.

Bumped 180→186 to RE-ANCHOR, not to make room: current had crept to 180.4 against
180. A backstop with no slack is not a backstop — it fails on the next trivial
change and gets raised without anyone thinking about it, which is the exact
failure the first-load note above describes. Nothing here grew unexpectedly.

186 → 192, and re-anchoring again for the same reason: current had reached 186.1
against 186. The growth is a plain-text exporter — an ON-DEMAND chunk, fetched when
someone opens the export menu and never on a page load, so first load is untouched.
That is precisely the "ordinary feature work" this note says the backstop should not
be pricing, and a backstop sitting 0.1 KB above current cannot catch the thing it
exists for. 192 restores the ~6 KB of slack the last re-anchor set.

192 → 258, and unlike the re-anchors above this one is buying something specific.

Same two-build measurement: 204.3 before the map work, 251.8 after. Two thirds of that
+47.5 KB is Leaflet and its stylesheet, and every byte is in an async chunk the editor's
HTML does not reference — a list with no route never asks for it. This is exactly the
split these two numbers exist to express: a feature that costs the ratchet almost
nothing and the backstop a lot is one that only its users download, which is the right
shape for a map inside a packing-list app.

It also means the backstop stops being able to say much about the map, so the thing that
actually polices it is MAX_CHUNK below. Note the 204.3 was already 12.3 KB over 192 for
the same unpriced-planning-work reason the first-load note gives.

258 restores the ~6 KB of slack the last two re-anchors set.

258 → 267, the ordinary-feature-work re-anchor this note keeps describing. 251.8 at the
anchor above, 260.5 now. Most of the +8.7 KB is the map chunk growing up: placing a pin,
the press-and-hold that lifts one, the day-boundary handles, the popup, full screen. All
of it is inside the chunk a list without a route never asks for, which is the shape this
backstop is explicitly not supposed to police.

MAX_CHUNK is still what actually watches that chunk: 36.5 KB against 72, unmoved by any
of it. 267 restores the ~6 KB of slack.

267 → 273, and this one is My Gear growing a page of its own (#224): adding and editing
gear in place, the item modal, the add row, the view/sort/show menus. Measured the same
two ways this note has always asked for — main at that commit builds to 269.0 against
267, before any of the audit branch's own work, which then adds 0.2. So the backstop was
already 2.0 KB under water on work that is precisely what it says it must not price: a
route people visit deliberately, not something shipped to every page.

Worth recording that this is the FIRST bump measured by the CI job landing in the same
branch. Every re-anchor above was found by somebody running the script by hand, after the
fact; #224 went in with the total already over and nothing said so. That is the gap
closing, and the reason the number is honest rather than convenient.

FIRST LOAD is untouched by it — 154.5 → 154.8, a third of a KB — because the page is its
own route chunk. MAX_CHUNK is unmoved at 36.5 against 72. 273 restores the ~4 KB of slack
the re-anchors above keep arguing for.

273 → 281, the people feature: naming who's on a trip, a "carried by" picker on every
row, filter chips on the editor and both read views, and a manage dialog. Measured both
ways as ever: main at this commit builds to 269.9 against 273 — 3.1 KB of slack before a
line of this work — and the feature adds 5.8 total. Most of it is genuinely shared
surface (the chips + row picker render on the editor AND the share pages, which is the
point of the feature), so unlike the map chunk it can't all hide off the hot path; the
dialog is the part that could be Lazy and is. FIRST LOAD wears its share honestly too,
151.1 → 154.2 against the 157 ratchet, inside the working headroom that number was last
re-anchored to keep. MAX_CHUNK unmoved at 36.5 against 72. 281 restores the ~5 KB of
slack the re-anchors above keep arguing for.

281 → 288, the same work: 279.9 before #302 against 281 (1.1 KB of slack), 283.0 after
it (#302's 3.1 is its share of the editor, plus the catalog-match chunk the import modal
loads on demand, plus the bare-address page's own chunk), 283.3 after #307 and #308.
MAX_CHUNK unmoved at 36.5 against 72. 288 restores the ~4.7 KB of slack the re-anchors
above keep arguing for.

288 → 278, the same re-anchor: 282.6 KB / 111 files → 272.3 KB / 88 files, all of it
the boot-graph merge above (fewer files compress better) — nothing left the build.
278 restores the ~5.7 KB of slack the re-anchors above keep arguing for.

278 → 283, My Gear keeping the note and the price, and exporting (#244). Measured both
ways: main at this commit builds to 274.6 against 278 (3.4 KB of slack), 279.0 with the
branch. The +4.4 is the /gear route chunk growing (price + note on the row and in the
dialog, the ⋯ menu, the total), plus two chunks nobody downloads until they ask — the
CSV/JSON exporter behind the menu, and the import dialog with its parser — which is the
shape this backstop is explicitly not supposed to police. FIRST LOAD is untouched by it,
150.4 → 150.6 against 151, because none of it is on the editor's path. MAX_CHUNK unmoved
at 52.9 against 72. 283 restores the ~4 KB of slack the re-anchors above keep arguing for.

283 → 287, the Trip tab reading three more things off what a list already holds: the
hours of daylight per day (#348), the longest dry carry between the water pins (#357),
and the camp's height, the longest climb and the steepest stretch off the profile
(#359). Measured both ways: main at e4acf7f builds to 280.8 against 283 (2.2 KB of
slack), 283.1 with the three together — each passed on its own, and it is the sum
that crosses the line. The +2.3 is all on the planning panel's chunk (three shared
modules and their sentences), which only a list opened in Trip view downloads. FIRST
LOAD is untouched, 151.1 → 151.0 against 153, because none of it is on the editor's
path. MAX_CHUNK unmoved at 52.9 against 72. 287 restores the ~4 KB of slack the
re-anchors above keep arguing for.

## 2026-10-06 · Pack selective carry collaboration

Measured a clean archive of `fa5939b` with the same installed dependencies and Node build: **151.62 KB** first load, **294.20 KB** total Brotli. The Pack fork was already above Mahonia's 150 / 294 KB thresholds before this feature.

With selective carry requests, independent recipient groups, packing state and optional Resend reminders: **151.9 KB** first load, **300.8 KB** total. The editor entry adds approximately **0.28 KB**; the approximately **6.6 KB** collaboration UI is a lazy chunk mounted only after opening its panel. No application dependency was added. The recipient route is also separate from editor first load.

Product case: this is Pack's core two-person backpacking workflow. Keep the compact/search customization baseline and price the small entry separately from deferred collaboration UI. First-load ceiling/tripwire become **153 KB**; the total backstop becomes **307 KB**, preserving the customary approximately 6 KB margin. Largest-chunk cap remains **72 KB**. Changes stay in the Pack fork and do not change upstream Mahonia's budgets.
