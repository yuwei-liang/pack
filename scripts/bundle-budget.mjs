// Brotli bundle-budget gate. The product shaves grams; the site shaves bytes.
//
// THE NUMBER THAT MATTERS IS FIRST LOAD — the JS/CSS a visitor to the editor actually
// downloads, read from the assets the prerendered /e references. Everything else in
// _nuxt (the /gear, /account, /about, /legal route chunks, the lazy modals, menus and
// panes) is counted only against a deliberately loose TOTAL backstop.
//
// It used to gate on the sum of every built file, and that measured the wrong thing
// by a wide margin: route-splitting a page and dynamically importing a pane bought
// nothing against the gate, so the guardrail actively taxed the optimisation the
// codebase is built around. Splitting the two numbers puts the incentive back the
// right way up: move code off the hot path and the first-load number falls.
//
// FIRST LOAD HAS TWO LINES, because one number was being asked to do two jobs and
// could only do one of them:
//
//   the CEILING  — a product decision. What the editor may cost every visitor, full
//                  stop. It is NOT re-anchored when a feature lands over it: the
//                  feature shaves in the same PR, or makes the product case for a
//                  heavier editor and moves the ceiling with that case written down.
//                  Moves for a framework major, or a decision — never for "the row
//                  grew a button".
//   the TRIPWIRE — an accident detector, ~2 KB above the last measurement. A heavy
//                  dependency, a stray static import of something meant to be lazy,
//                  a checked-in JSON riding a page: all trip it before they reach the
//                  ceiling. Re-anchor it freely, in the PR that spends it, to current
//                  + ~2 — no essay: CI posts every PR's delta against main, by source,
//                  and that comment is the record.
//
// For eleven weeks the tripwire was the only line, and it was raised twenty-one times
// with a paragraph each and lowered twice — scripts/bundle-budget-ledger.md keeps every
// one of those paragraphs. They are good history and they were never a "no"; the
// ceiling is.
//
// Run after `nuxt build`: `npm run build && npm run bundle-budget`. With
// `--report=<path>` it also writes the measurement as JSON — per file, and per source
// when the build carried hidden sourcemaps (CI's does: BUNDLE_MAPS=1, see nuxt.config)
// — which is what scripts/bundle-delta.mjs diffs against main's.

// THE CEILING. 150 KB brotli for the editor's first load, set 2026-09-12 at 146.6
// measured, after a menu left the hot path and the icon set lost its fourth decimal.
// Of that 146.6: 66 KB is the framework (vue, nuxt, vue-router, unhead, ofetch —
// the floor, movable only by a framework change), 14 KB is CSS, 8 KB is glyphs,
// 54 KB is the product, and the rest is chunk glue. The product's share had grown
// from ~48 to ~80 KB in the seven weeks before this line was drawn (118.6 → 151.1
// on this number, net of a 10 KB delivery pass), which is the growth the line
// exists to price.
//
// When it bites, the levers in order: a surface that only opens on a click goes
// Lazy (the shape every modal, the ⋯ menu and the panes already have); an icon
// sprite as a static asset (~8 KB off this number, cached across deploys, and a
// third of the row's DOM with it); the account and vault machinery behind a
// signed-in check (~4 KB an anonymous visitor never needs). Beyond those it is a
// product conversation, and this is the number that starts it.
// Pack fork, 2026-10-06: the unchanged fa5939b baseline is already 151.62 KB.
// Carry collaboration adds 0.28 KB to first load; its 6.6 KB UI loads on demand.

// to 0.3 KB each — none an accident, so none tripped it, which is the drift a

// Re-set 2026-09-13 at 288.1 measured (was 288, drawn at 281.9): the 6 KB went to
// feature work spread across lazy chunks — the trip tab's day facts, the fuel rules,
// the account cache split — and the last 0.2 to the map-file reader becoming a chunk
// of its own, which is the first-load lever working as intended. No chunk grew.

// budget tripled is precisely what the budget is for. Leaflet lands at 36.5 KB, half of it,
// which is why it was the one that could be taken. Unchanged by the map work.
// Since the boot-graph merge the largest chunk is the framework runtime (`vendor`,

 * <script src>, rel="modulepreload", rel="stylesheet" and rel="preload" mean

 * CatalogCorrectionModal.css. That contradicted this file's own header (lazy panes
 * and modals belong to the TOTAL backstop) and, worse, inverted the incentive the
 * split exists to create: making the vault pane lazy is supposed to move its weight
 * off the ratchet, but with its prefetch still counted it earned nothing, and every
 * KB the lazy pane grew was billed to first load anyway.

 *
 * EVERY BYTE IS CHARGED TO SOMETHING, so the rows sum to the totals they explain:
 * a mapped chunk's segments go to their source files, the bytes before a line's
 * first segment and on lines with no segment (the `import{…}from` headers and the
 * preload tables the bundler writes, which grow with the chunk graph) to "(glue)",
 * a CSS file to `css:<its stem>` (a .css has no map, but its name is stable across
 * hashes), and a script with no map to "(unmapped chunk)". Without this the receipt
 * could say "+1.5 KB" up top and "nothing moved" underneath — the CSS-only change.
 *
 * A source's brotli is estimated at its chunk's own compression ratio — an
 * estimate, and a fair one: a file compresses about the same whichever chunk it
 * lands in. Each chunk is walked once; first-load and total are two sums over it.
