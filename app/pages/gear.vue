// (the API is /api/vault/*, the tables vault_*, the classes .vault__*) — see the
// /vault redirect in nuxt.config for that decision.
//
// Owned by your ACCOUNT — the one part of Mahonia that asks you to sign in. Lists
// stay link-owned and always will; a vault is different because it's the durable
// record of what you own, and the thing you'd most hate to lose to a cleared
// browser. Signing in on another device is what carrying it there means now.

// It is also the one place the gear itself can be MAINTAINED: added by hand, and

// automatic write must never talk over a deliberate one — so an edit PINS the field

           at it, so it doesn't belong beside View and Show.
           Present for anyone signed in, because Import works on an empty vault —
           restoring a backup onto a new machine is the case with nothing to export
           and the most reason to be here. The DOWNLOAD rows are the ones gated on
           having gear (canExport): a control worth no action is absent, not inert.
           ClientOnly for the reason the page body is: the server has no session, and
           a signed-in browser hydrates with one, so a v-if on it mismatches. -->
