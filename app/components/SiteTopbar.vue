        <!-- last, so a page's own action stays the prominent one.
             `compact` FORWARDS: it's the read views' flag, and their trailing group is
             a glyph row (the ⋯ menu) behind one text action. Left unforwarded, the bar
             was inconsistent with itself — signed in it drew the account glyph, signed
             out it drew the word "Sign in", so the same corner changed shape on a state
             that has nothing to do with shape. AccountMenu already carries the icon
             variant for exactly this; it was simply unreachable here. The plain word
             stays on /about, /legal and friends, which don't pass compact. -->

        <!-- After the account control, for the one thing that outranks it at the end
             of a bar: an overflow ⋯. The editor already ends this way (vault, account,
             share, ⋯), so a bar that put ⋯ mid-row read as a different bar. It isn't a
             competing action — it's the end-cap, and it's where a hand goes looking. -->
