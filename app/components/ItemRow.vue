 * Commit whatever number field is being edited before a control in this row acts on it.
 *
 * Every button in the row prevents its own mousedown default — see the actions cluster's
 * comment in the template for why (a click out of a focused field would otherwise blur
 * the row, and discardEmpty would take a pristine one out from under the click). What
 * that costs is the blur, and the blur is what fires `change` — which is where onQty and
 * onWeight commit. So a number you typed and then acted on WITHOUT leaving the field was
 * never stored: the toggle re-rendered the row, the field repainted from a state that had
 * never heard about it, and the number you had just typed was simply gone. Reported as
 * the amount or the weight disappearing when a row is made consumable, which is the
 * shortest path to it — type a weight, tap the cookie, watch it empty itself — but every
 * mousedown-prevented control in the row had the same hole, worn and the ⋯ menu included.
 *
 * Dispatching the field's own `change` runs the exact commit the blur would have run, and
 * both handlers resync from state afterwards, so the later real blur re-firing it is a
 * no-op. Focus stays where it was, which is the whole point of the prevent.
 *
 * ON CLICK, CAPTURE — not pointerdown, which is where this started. Committing that early
 * re-lays the row out mid-gesture: clearing a weight drops the row below vaultWorthy, the
 * vault icon leaves the actions cluster, every cell shifts, and the button the finger was
 * on is no longer under it at mouseup — so the tap that triggered the commit then landed
 * on nothing and the popover never opened. By click the gesture has already resolved.
 * Capture so this still runs BEFORE the control's own handler; Vue patches the DOM on the
 * microtask, so nothing has moved by the time that handler runs.
 *
 * NUMBER FIELDS ONLY (.field--num — qty, weight, and the popovers' kcal). The name field
 * commits through the autocomplete's own path (NameCommit), and firing a bare `change`
 * underneath that would be a second, blinder way to commit a catalog pick.

//  • Not yet gear: a row with no name, or no weight and no catalog link, has
//    nothing to save (isVaultWorthy — capture's own rule; groups and water are
//    out the same way). The old always-present button's only outcome there was a
//    toast telling you to finish the row — so a NEW item shows no icon at all,
//    and finishing the row is what makes it arrive (the reveal below).
//  • Already banked: asking out loud to save what's saved is offering to do what's
//    done — so the button leaves again. (It used to stay, dimmed and
//    aria-disabled, reading "Already in My Gear".) Two ways a row is banked, and
//    for three attempts this only knew the second: My Gear ALREADY HOLDS the gear
//    (vaultKeys — however it got there), or the automatic path is about to put it
//    there for this list (a vault to reach, this list's answer is yes, the chooser
//    didn't decline it). Judging by the second alone made the button reappear on
//    gear that had been banked for months, every time the list's own answer wasn't
//    yes — the same list opened on a second device, a list answered "no", a row
//    unticked in the chooser, anything typed in from /gear. Fail both and the
//    worthy row keeps its button, because pressing it is then the only way this
//    row gets banked.
//
// Neither gate can race live typing: they read the committed snapshot, and the
// fields that feed worthiness settle before they commit — the name on
// enter/blur/pick (ItemInput.commitFree), the weight on change — never per
// keystroke. So the button arrives once, when the row's facts do, not letter by

        <!-- QUANTITY — a stepper, not a box to fill in. Every change to a count is
             ±1 in practice ("take a second gas canister"), and as a bare field that
             cost a click in, a select-all and a keystroke to move a 1 to a 2.
             The number is STILL a field, because the tail of the distribution is
             real — fourteen tent stakes shouldn't be fourteen presses — it just
             stopped being the only way in. It carries no box of its own: between the
             two buttons it reads as the stepper's value rather than as a third
             control (see .item__qty--step).
             ON THE DESKTOP GRID ONLY. Every part of the row is rendered here and the
             MODE picks which parts show, the same division the editing↔packing swap
             makes: a media query can decide this, a prop would re-render every row on
             every resize. The mobile line is where the ± stand down and the "×" comes
             back to punctuate the count instead — nine controls already share 343px
             there, and with no columns to separate them the stepper's + landed
             against the weight and "− 4 + 540 g" read as one run-on figure. The
             grid's own columns are what make the same three parts legible up here.
             WATER is the exception at every width and keeps the plain field: that
             cell holds LITRES — a continuous measure driving the row's weight, not a
             count — so ±1 would be both the wrong step and the wrong idea.
             A BARE GROUP HAS NO CELL HERE AT ALL, the way its weight cell is read-only:
             the column beside it shows the group TOTAL, which the row's own count is
             already inside and which never reached the children — so a "×N" against it
             multiplies a figure with nothing left to multiply. A container the app makes
             holds nothing of its own (containerFor wraps any row that does), so the
             count it hides is a factor on zero; a group that DID arrive carrying a line
             keeps its stepper, because a control removed is a number nobody can see or
             correct. Water keeps its cell either way — that is a volume, not a count,
             and the weight field beside it is read-only on a group, so dropping it would
             leave the row with no editable figure at all. The grid keeps the track
             regardless: the columns are named areas off --item-cols, not the cells that
             sit in them, so the weight column stays put and a parent lines up with its
             children. Two of a kit is a second group: "Duplicate" carries the children. -->
        <!-- No spacer stands in for it on the phone line either. One did, so a group's
             total would start where a sibling row's weight does, but with nothing to
             its left the total read as a broken wrap (Sept 2026, prod). A row's second
             line starts at its own left edge, like every other row's. -->

             holds one value with base stored as null, so "both off" IS base: the pair
             renders the type directly instead of restating it. Each toggle also opens
             the one detail that only exists while it is on — worn's split count,
             consumable's calories — so the row itself gains no third control.
             CONSUMABLE FIRST, worn second. Water is why: its class is fixed, so its
             row draws a lit mark instead of a toggle — and only with consumable in
             the leading slot does that mark land in the same column as every other
             row's cookie (the worn slot beside it is held open by a ghost below). -->
        <!-- THE TRAILING CLUSTER — the marks and the controls, as one thing. On the
             desktop grid this wrapper is `display: contents`, so both cells drop into
             their own columns exactly as they did loose; it exists for the mobile line,
             where the two have to wrap TOGETHER. Split, they made two ragged rows of
             icons: the class cell ends in a centred glyph 13px inside its box and the
             actions end in the grip, whose dots deliberately overshoot to the row’s
             edge, so the stacked lines’ ink landed 19px apart and lined up in no
             column at all. One item can only wrap whole. -->
        <div class="item__trail">
          <!-- ...and the marks stand down on a BARE GROUP for the same reason the count
               does. A class describes ONE row's own line, and a container's is zero — it
               contributes nothing to Base/Worn/Consumable whatever the toggles say, and
               it does not govern its children either: they inherit the FOLDER's default,
               never their parent's (effectiveClassification). So a lit cookie on a group
               is a claim about food that no number under it answers to, sitting where the
               eye reads it as covering the total beside it. A group carrying a line of
               its own keeps the marks — there the class does decide which bucket that
               line lands in. -->

               takes that column — above its rows' consumable marks, which is where the
               eye already goes for "food" — in the same muted italic voice as the total
               beside it (Ryan, 2026-09-05). The share view prints the same words in the
               same column. -->

                 out). Same disclosure rule as the nesting menu below, which also only
                 exists while it has an action to offer. It sits FIRST in the cluster,
                 at the open left edge, with the optional nesting control: the cluster
                 is right-aligned, so a conditional icon in

                 Not on water rows, the same rule the ⋯ menu applies: water is never
                 gear (isVaultWorthy), so the button's only possible outcome there was

                 cluster read as noise and you had to hover each to learn which was which.
                 One trigger, and the menu SAYS what each action does.
                 Its glyph is node-add, not the indent arrow it wore first: the arrow drew
                 ONE of the entries behind it, and not the one that leads — a row's first
                 (often only) offer is a nested item, so an arrow promised the wrong thing
                 on most rows and lied outright on a nested one. Duplicate next door also
                 carries a plus; that one is enclosed in its square and this one stands
                 free above the branch, and both name themselves on hover.
                 Rendered only when there is something to offer — a nested row that can't
                 un-nest, or a parent with nothing to indent under, gets no icon at all
                 rather than a menu that opens empty.
                 item__nestact: stands down while a person filter is on (atoms/item.scss)
                 — "the item above" is unfiltered order, so indent could target a row the
                 CSS is hiding, and a nested row inherits its parent, so either action
                 can make the row vanish from the very view it was touched in. -->

     spec leaves the engine to derive. Where the engines disagree about it, that is what
     put the "lb" a fraction above the "0.03" it belongs to, visibly in Safari. The mobile

     below), which needs no baseline from this wrap at all.
     THE DESKTOP CELL ABOVE STILL ASKS, AND THAT IS FINE — measured, not assumed.
     Chromium and WebKit both land the unit's ink within half a pixel of the number's at
     1100px, the same residue the fixed mobile cell reads, so there is nothing here to
     fix and no reason to spend the desktop grid's baseline on it. What actually diverges
     is a cell with NO TEXT ANYWHERE (the mobile line's two icon-only clusters); a centred
     wrap like this one leads with a text span, and both engines take its baseline from
     that. Re-measure from INK, never from the box model, if this is ever revisited: the

       • --radius-pill over a 32×44 box draws a tall OVAL, not a chip, so a lit
         water mark was a different shape from a lit toggle.

   over the icon held at full ink, whose final frame is the no-mask state, so the
   sweep ends where rest begins. When the enter class lifts, the button's own
   color transition (above) settles the lit glyph onto --ink-3 — the SAME token

   gates the standard enter/leave classes, the same idiom as the row's menus. And
   no `appear`: a fresh row (or page) animates nothing; the shine plays only when
   an EXISTING row's button comes back, which is the beat that means something
   ("you can save this now").
   One duration for both animations, keyed off the ROOT: Vue times the transition
   from the root element's animation, so a longer sweep on the inner svg would be
   cut off mid-shine when the class comes off. The pop instead lands early inside
   the shared window and holds; the sweep starts a beat later (delay +

     It used to be nowrap, with a `max-width: 360px and pointer: coarse` carve-out
     below that flipped it to wrap — the one width where nowrap was measured to fail.
     That was the wrong shape for the rule: it named a width, and the answer it gave

     A breakpoint only holds until the next thing joins the line — the gap floor just
     below moved it once already — and when it stops holding the failure is not a
     tight row but a grip sitting past the edge of the screen.
     flex-wrap is self-tuning instead: a row that fits is untouched (wrap does nothing
     when there is no overflow to resolve), and a row that doesn't drops its actions
     cluster to a line of its own — exactly what the 360px block did, for the same

       for the same reason, arriving here last.
       `baseline` only works when every item on the line HAS a text baseline to share.
       Half of this line doesn't: the qty cell, the unit wrap and both icon clusters are
       flex boxes that centre their own contents, so none of them offers a baseline and
       each one gets a SYNTHESIZED one instead — a value the spec leaves the engine to
       derive, and here the engines disagreed. Measured from the rendered ink against the
       pre-fix rules: WebKit put the count 2px off the weight beside it, and the grip 2px
       off the numbers, while Blink did not move a pixel — its own error was sub-pixel
       (the unit 0.4px high, the class toggles 0.8px above the ⋯ and the grip), which is
       to say Chrome reports this line as fine. Four cells, four reference edges, and no
       width at which they all agree.
       It takes a cell with NO TEXT ANYWHERE to break, which is why the icon clusters are
       the ones that did. A centred wrap that leads with a text span is not enough on its
       own — both engines take its baseline from that span, which is why the identically
       shaped .totals__uc, .headline__uc and .folder__actions were measured in WebKit and
       left alone.
       Centring needs no baseline from anyone, and it does not cost the numbers theirs:
       within one line box the baseline sits (ascent − descent) / 2 below the centre
       REGARDLESS of the box's height, so at one font size — which this whole line is —
       centring the boxes puts the text baselines on exactly the same y that baseline
       alignment was reaching for. The icons come along to that line's optical centre,
       which is where the row's other icon groups already aim. */

       It SHRINKS on the narrowest screens rather than holding at space-4 and
       overflowing. Once the classification cell became two toggles, a coarse
       pointer's --tap sizing left this line needing more width than a 375px phone
       has, and a fixed gap spends on air the controls need. Above ~640px it
       resolves to space-4 and nothing changes.
       The FLOOR is --space-3, not --space-2. At 8px the separation between the
       groups was only 4px more than the separation inside them (a number and its
       own unit), which is not a difference you can see — "1 × 540 g" read as one
       run of figures rather than a count and a weight. 12px against 4px is a ratio
       you can, and it is the one piece of this the grid gets for free from having
       columns at all. The 4px it costs a 375px line is affordable; below that the
       line wraps, which it already did.

     BOTH icon groups on this line, not just the trailing one. The classification cell
     held a text label when this rule was written; once it became two --tap buttons it
     stood 44px tall inside a ~25px text line, and the flex line grew to fit it — which
     is the whole problem, and it is not one the line's own alignment can solve. A 44px

     its tallest item, and this rule ran when the line was still `baseline`, where the

     So the fix has to be the BOX, not the alignment: shrink each icon's footprint back
     to the text line's height and let the 44px target overflow it. That is what keeps
     the editing↔packing height parity .item--check is built around — the inflated line
     made an edit row 19px taller than the checklist row it toggles into, so the list
     jumped on every mode switch — and it is why these margins stay load-bearing now

     horizontal at 16: a 32×32 ground with its sides shaved flat. Squaring the border

     It is width that decides how many stay: on a coarse pointer every .btn--icon grows
     to --tap, so each inline icon costs 48px of a line that also has to carry the qty,
     the weight and the two classification toggles. Delete was the last one held back —

     it inline, a NESTED row (indented --space-5) needed ~421px of viewport for a
     four-figure weight, so "1 × 1,588 g" one level down ran its grip off the side of
     every iPhone but the largest; at 375 even a top-level six-figure weight went ~15px
     over. Two icons is what the line can hold, and the drag grip and the menu that
     carries everything else are the two that have to be reachable.

     own .menu div — hiding only the button leaves those wrappers as zero-width flex
     items, and a zero-width flex item still takes its share of the cluster's gap. That
     was three phantom 4px gaps inside a cluster whose visible content is two buttons,
     and the nesting one is CONDITIONAL (a group row offers no nest action), so the
     cluster came out 4px narrower on group rows than on the rest — enough to knock
     those rows out of the column the classification cell now rides. :has() is what

     formed a column. Pushing the cell right instead parks it against the actions —
     both clusters then ride the row's right edge, on every row, and the desktop grid's
     fixed class track (tokens.scss) gets its mobile equivalent. It costs no width: the
     free space it eats is the slack the widest row in the list doesn't have anyway.
     It must be the ONLY auto margin on the line — a second one splits the free space
     between them and the drift comes straight back at half size. The line that the
     cluster wraps onto is the SAME cluster (.item__trail is one flex item), so
     .item__meta's own justify-content right-anchors it there, not a second margin.
     The margin rides the cluster rather than the cell inside it, which is what makes
