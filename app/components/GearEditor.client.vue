// the WORLD — and the answer reads better as a pair than as two pages.
//
// A menu row was said to be too small to hold that distinction; what actually holds
// it is the dialog, which has always been where the difference was explained. The
// rows only have to be told apart at a glance, and they are: one is red and throws
// the list away, the other is plain and takes it off a shelf.
//
// Off on an unsaved draft. shareCode is the reactive stand-in for "has a server
// row": it and the edit token are set in the same breath (createFromDraft), and
// c.editToken is a plain getter that no computed can track. A draft is not yet a

//
// "Leave the list standing" is only true while its token is alive. This menu also
// renders in the "No longer online · saved on device" state — the server 404'd the
// token but a local copy kept the editor standing — and there the on-device copy IS
// the list as far as this browser can reach: forgetting discards it, unsynced edits
// and all, and what's discarded may be all that's left. Same act, two different
// losses; the dialog has always been where the difference between these rows is
// explained, so the dialog (not the row) is what changes.
//
// It MUST navigate away, which is not cosmetic. load() re-registers a list it opens

     buttons are wrapped by <Tooltip>, so a class on the BUTTON lands on the wrapper's
     child and the flex item it needed to be on is the wrapper. Putting it here works
     whatever the cluster is made of.
     A PLAIN <div>, and that is the fix rather than a tidiness. The class used to ride
     SyncStatus itself, on the reasoning that "an auto margin on a zero-width item still
     eats the free space before it" — true of a zero-width item, and SyncStatus is not
     one: it is `v-if="shown"`, so with nothing to report it renders NO ELEMENT, taking
     this margin with it. On an untouched draft the whole tool cluster then collapsed
     back against the switcher. The bar's own layout can't be a child's to opt out of. */
