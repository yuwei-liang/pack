// A DIALOG rather than an in-flow .reveal, and the motion vocabulary is why: that
// family is for "a row's note" (atoms/controls.scss), and ten fields is a form, not
// a note. Two mechanical reasons agree. The classification picker is an absolutely
// positioned .menu__list, and /gear's rows live inside .folder__bodyinner's
// `overflow: hidden` — going in-flow would mean growing the editor's whole
// overlay-lift apparatus for one control. And the row is a drag handle whose
// createPressArm excludes buttons but NOT inputs, so selecting text in an inline
// weight field would arm a re-file at 5px of travel.
//
// The cost, plainly: a run of tidy-ups is open/edit/save per row rather than tabbing
// down a column. Acceptable because /gear's row is DISPLAY — turning it into the
// editor's live form is a bigger change than this page wants to be.
